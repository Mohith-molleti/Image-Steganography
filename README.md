# Image-Steganography
Project Title: Secure Data Transmission Using Image Steganography

Objective: Develop a system to conceal confidential information within digital images, ensuring data remains hidden from unauthorized users while being retrievable by authorized individuals.

Key Components:

Encoding Module: This module integrates the secret data into an image by altering the image's pixel values subtly, preserving its visual integrity. A common technique used is Least Significant Bit (LSB) insertion, where the least significant bits of pixel values are replaced with the secret data bits.

Decoding Module: This module extracts the hidden information from the image by reversing the encoding process to retrieve the original data.

User Interface: A user-friendly interface, either graphical or command-line based, is provided for users to encode and decode messages easily.

Security Features: Encryption is applied to the secret data before embedding it into the image, ensuring that even if the stego image is intercepted, the concealed information remains protected.

Performance Evaluation: The system's effectiveness is evaluated by assessing the quality of the stego image and the data hiding capacity. Metrics like image quality and data capacity are used to ensure the system meets the required standards.

Applications: The system can be used for secure communication, digital watermarking, and digital rights management.

This project integrates cryptographic techniques with image processing to offer a secure method for data transmission.
